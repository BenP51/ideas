# Ideas

For every time I get passionate. Feel more than welcome to contribute or fork.

We all have stuff that might be cool to actually see working.
Here are a few of mine

## Desktop Image Grabber
 - Starts with search bar and three select buttons that represent Instagram, Facebook and Twitter.
 --* Input search (username) and select one of the three social networks.
 --* Returns all images from user inputed.
 - Select image(s) with button in top right of image thumbnail. Button in bottom right of window to save selected images.
 - Clicking thumbnail of image expands it.
 - White and minimalistic design.

## Film Calendar
 - Small iphone or web app
 - "I saw ____ on _____"
 - "I rate it \_\_/10"
 - and notes section

## Movie Recommender
 - Recommends movies based on top 5 favorite movies.
 - Use canistreamit API to check where you can watch it.
 - Use omdb api for recommmendations or at least movie metadata.

## Wifi Password Social Network
 - Public Database where you input location of wifi network and its username/password.
 - Use google maps api for locations
 - You have to give one password to have access to the site. (Sorta like the way you have to seed to torrent)

## Room Mapping with Wifi
 - Build this in with previous idea.
 - Kind of like the end of The Dark Knight Rises except not SONAR but wifi. Theres some base level research on this shit already

## TTT social Network
 - Blogs (Like Reddit+4chan+Twitter)
 --* Random (4chan.org/b for ttt)
 --* Rant (I am sick and tired of ____ so I'm going to complain here so other people can justify me and create one massive circlejerk.)
 --* Stories (Fiction or Non fiction. Open place to write stuff.)
 - News (Cool tech news or things we've been doing)
 - Startups (Look at my business!)
 - Ideas
 --* Team Search (I need someone to help me build _____. I need someone who knows ____.)
 - Skills/About Us/The team (I am ___ and I know ____ languages. I am passionate about _____)

## Email CLI
 - -e "_EMAIL_" Email Address to send to
 - -m "_MESSAGE_" The Message to send
 - -s "_SUBJECT_" The Subject to attach to the email


## Schedule Manger/Creator
- input all blocks you're in
- select what type of academic cycle you're on (term/semester)
- give time frames for blocks (9-10 for band, etc)
- the app would then add each event for the entire year for each individual class to your Calendar
- Have an alarm for a user defined interval before a class (Really useful for college)
- Notes section for each block (something like a reminder)
- Ability to sync with multi devices/cross platfrom

## [Homework Databases](https://homehelp.github.io)
- See the code here: [github](https://github.com/homehelp/homehelp.github.io)
- Basically a website that takes answers to worksheets from across the web and puts them in one place
- Seach through documents, catagorized by subject
- Like [Khan Academy](https://khanacademy.com/) but more open source
- We must give credit to original answer makers
- Prototype up at [homehelp.github.io](https://homehelp.github.io)

## Instant Music Player (without data or local files)
- text [Twilio](twilio.com) number with your song choice
- (probably) Rails server goes and downloads that song (from YouTube or something, convert it to .mp3)
- the number then calls you and plays the song
- supposed to be quick and easy, simple alternative to using stuff like Spotify becuase that requires data

## Instant Phonebook (without data or local files)
- Text [Twilio](twilio.com) with a first and last name or reverse lookup with a phone number
- Twilio server checks Yellow/White Pages for number, if not there it'll check its databases
- Databases contian numbers that've texted it before with certain commands (i.e. "add me - name, surname")

## Cleverbot with Twilio
- As you can probably tell by now I'm obsessed with Twilio
- Make Cleverbot run on Twilio
- That's it

## CLI with [Forecast.io](http://forecast.io/)
- This has been done before but I basically just want to improve upon it
- Make simple commands like `forecast local`, `forecast V3A2Z6`, `forecast Vancouver`
- Save all user settings (postal/zip code, city, province/state, country, etc) in `~/.forcast.json` for easy snatchin

## CLI Card game on localhost
- [I've kind of made this already but it's buggy af ](https://github.com/probablyjosh/cards) and it also doesn't work on localhost or support anything other than Blackjack
- Make it better and I'll be your friend a ton

## Tinder for High School
- Essentially Tinder but more location orientated
- when signing up, checks your current location and if it's a school sets that as your school
- only shows people from the school or possibly schools very close in proximity

## Fully Text (SMS) based Twitter
- Text number with Twitter Credentials, and it returns with 10 tweets
- These tweets are ordered and numbered, so the user can reply "2 RT" to retweet the second tweet sent through SMS
- This is already done sort of by Twitter already, but it needs improvement
