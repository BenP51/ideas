we all have stuff that might be cool to actually see working
here are a few IMO

apps
----

Schedule Manger/Creator
- input all blocks you're in
- select what type of academic cycle you're on (term/semester)
- give time frames for blocks (9-10 for band, etc)
- the app would then add each event for the entire year for each individual class to your Calendar
- Have an alarm for a user defined interval before a class (Really usefull for college)
- Notes section for each block (something like a reminder)
- Ablity to synce with multi devices/cross platfrom
