we all have stuff that might be cool to actually see working
here are a few IMO

Schedule Manger/Creator
- input all blocks you're in
- select what type of academic cycle you're on (term/semester)
- give time frames for blocks (9-10 for band, etc)
- the app would then add each event for the entire year for each individual class to your Calendar
- Have an alarm for a user defined interval before a class (Really usefull for college)
- Notes section for each block (something like a reminder)
- Ablity to synce with multi devices/cross platfrom 


Instant music player (without data or local files)
- text [Twilio](twilio.com) number with your song choice
- (probably) Rails server goes and downloads that song (from YouTube or something, convert it to .mp3)
- the number then calls you and plays the song
- supposed to be quick and easy, simple alternative to using stuff like Spotify becuase that requires data
